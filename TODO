Add Kuro's Ao drawing as desktop image.

Start with a fullscreen jspanel, with a jquery terminal inside.

Create a simple window manager, that arranges windows like this:
________________________
|           |          |
|           |          |
|           |__________|
|           |          |
|           |          |
|___________|__________|

Add a JQuery Terminal to the windows (for now they do nothing).

Add keybinds to: 
    create a window can only create three windows for now.
    close a window
    change MASTER window
    Switch window

Preffered Binds (if possible):
    Super+Enter
    Super+x
    Super+Left_Alt+Enter
    Super+j

OnHover switch highlight and switch terminal window.
